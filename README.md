# Kattis-Helper
Kattis Helper Web Project, for the aspiring Thomas.

Kattis Helper is a website that aims to facilitate users with solving Kattis problems.

Kattis (open.kattis.com) is a website that provides programming problems, of which many are from
programming competitions. Users are able to submit code on the Kattis website itself, but Kattis
itself does not have any options for user discussion, or allowing users to test their code (users
are only able to submit code and are told only whether their answers are correct or wrong).

With this, Kattis Helper was designed with user discussion and testing, which the Kattis website
does not. Built on nodejs express, Kattis Helper is hosted on herokuapp, using mongoDB atlas as
cloud database for storage, with Sphere Engine for the online compiler.

Users are able to create accounts to engage in forum discussion for problems, while also being able
to test out their code in the online compiler in Kattis Helper. 

To access the website, users can use this link: https://kattis-helper.herokuapp.com/

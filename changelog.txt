Kattis Helper Changelog:
===================================================================================================
23/5/19:
	Initial build
	Added static question page
	
27/5/19:
	Tidied up layout, current template page can be found at template.html
	Added problemPage.html (display the queried problem for hte user)
	Added local storage for session (call the script localStorageHandler.js)

23/6/19:
	After a long hiatus, work has continued
	Tidied up some stuff, implemented searching function for question names (based on URL only)
	Note: this is not case sensitive, but certain questions like Fire! have ID as fire3 instead
	we strictly follow the name based on the URL
	Problems list now is in a table form
	
24/6/19:
	Changed questions.json format to support more information
	Question page now fetches the appropriate information and stores in local storage
	* We don't want to keep fetching info at a time, so throw them in local storage
	
26/6/19:
	Merged questions.json using new format
	Added 100 sample questions
	Problem page now correctly loads in the information
	Tidied up problem page layout
	
To do:
Problems list: add a next button, and show only 100 entries (atm we only have 100 so it's ok)

Add in the extra buttons for the separate functionalities for problem page (might have to re-render
everytime we switch)
Add these buttons to the above: Test Cases, IDE, forum

Maybe put in random question finder for the front page

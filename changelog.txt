Kattis Helper Changelog:
===================================================================================================
23/5/19:
	Initial build
	
	Added static question page
	
27/5/19:
	Tidied up layout, current template page can be found at template.html
	
	Added problemPage.html (display the queried problem for hte user)
	
	Added local storage for session (call the script localStorageHandler.js)

23/6/19:
	After a long hiatus, work has continued
	
	Tidied up some stuff, implemented searching function for question names (based on URL only)
	Note: this is not case sensitive, but certain questions like Fire! have ID as fire3 instead
	we strictly follow the name based on the URL
	
	Problems list now is in a table form
	
24/6/19:
	Changed questions.json format to support more information
	
	Question page now fetches the appropriate information and stores in local storage
	* We don't want to keep fetching info at a time, so throw them in local storage
	
26/6/19:
	Merged questions.json using new format
	
	Added 100 sample questions
	
	Problem page now correctly loads in the information
	
	Tidied up problem page layout
	
27/6/19:
	Added linking of questions from problem list to actual problem page
	
	Fixed bug: searching for a new problem when at the problem page, does not render the sample
	test cases properly
	
	Added context menu switching for problem page:
		details, test case, IDE, forum (tentative menus)
		all 4 context menus are stored in a hidden div in the page
	Split generation and rendering of all 4 context menus
	
	Test case context menu currently
		Currently hooks onto sample test cases until I bother to copy over for each question
		Possibly want to include a flag to check whether the question has test cases that we have
		or not
		Total number of test cases for the question will be manually added
		Determine whether we have the test cases or not via checking the IO list against the
		known number of test cases for those questions
		
28/6/19:
	Added rendering of random questions in the index page
	Added placeholder stuff for IDE
	
	Hooked test case context menu to use the internal test cases instead of only the sample test cases
	
To do:
Problems list: add a next button, and show only 100 entries (atm we only have 100 so it's ok)

userStorage item: problemStatus (shows which context menu is used (pending deletion if not used)
